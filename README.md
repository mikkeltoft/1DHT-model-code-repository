# 1DHT model code repository

MatLab script and instructions for the 1DHT model developed and first presented in Hornum et al. (2020)

The 1DHT model is a transient one-dimensional heat transfer model suitable for simulating permafrost dynamics. 
The core of the model is an explicit forward-difference time approximation of the one-dimensional heat transfer equation. 
See the supplementary info to Hornum et al. (2020) for model code validation.
The script 'Code_1DHT_model.m' is tailored to simulate the Holocene ground temperature
development in Adventdalen, Svalbard, but may be modified to fit other purposes.

To save the figures (simulations) produced by 'Code_1DHT_model.m', run 'Save_data.m' consecutively.
